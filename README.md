# BusyOrNot
While leaving my dorm during the Corona lockdown, I had to adapt. Living back at home, having a lot more digital meetings, online classes and job interviews. Only I wasn't the only one doing having this, being a CS student, I also count as IT for our family. To have less distractions I decided to make a simple web-app which shows if people can knock and enter my room, or if they have to stay out.  
## Installation and start 
`yarn install`  
`npm start`  
## Change the state
Wanting to keep things clean, changing the state of the webpage is done browsing (get) `localhost:3001/setstate`.
